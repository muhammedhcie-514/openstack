The backend resource pools of Glance, Cinder, Cinder-backup, and Manila are previously
defined in global.yml. This section guides you through creating corresponding resource
pools in Ceph and generating their respective keyring files. These resource pools include:
Glance resource pool images with user glance
Cinder resource pool volumes with user cinder
Cinder-backup resource pool backups with user cinder-backup
Manila resource pool cephfs with user manila

3.3.1 Creating Resource Pools
Create required resource pools.
##### Creating the Glance resource pool
ceph osd pool create glance
ceph osd pool application enable glance rbd
ceph auth add client.glance mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=glance'
##### Creating the Cinder resource pool
ceph osd pool create volumes
ceph osd pool application enable volumes rbd
ceph auth add client.cinder mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=volumes'
ceph osd pool create backups
ceph osd pool application enable backups rbd
ceph auth add client.cinder-backup mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=backups'
##### Creating the Manila resource pool
ceph osd pool create metadata_cephfs
ceph osd pool create data_cephfs
ceph fs new cephfs metadata_cephfs data_cephfs
ceph orch apply mds cephfs --placement="2" 



3.3.2 Creating and Exporting Keyring Files
Run the following commands to create and export keyring files:
ceph auth get client.glance -o ceph.client.glance.keyring
ceph auth get client.cinder -o ceph.client.cinder.keyring
ceph auth get client.cinder-backup -o ceph.client.cinder-backup.keyring
ceph auth get-or-create client.manila -o ceph.clinetmanila.keyring mgr 'allow rw' mon 'allow r



3.3.3 Adding Ceph-related Configurations
Step 1 Add Glance-related configurations.
Create the /etc/kolla/config/glance directory and create ceph.conf in it with the
following content:
[global]
fsid = 306410d2-e503-11ee-86f8-xxxxxxxxxx
keyring = /etc/ceph/ceph.client.glance.keyring
mon_initial_members = ceph-0
mon_host = 192.168.1.134
auth_cluster_required = cephx
auth_service_required = cephx
auth_client_required = cephx
In addition, copy the Glance keyring file created in section 3.3.2 to this directory.


Step 2 Add Cinder-related configurations.
Create the /etc/kolla/config/cinder directory and create subdirectories cinder-backup
and cinder-volume in it. Then, create ceph.conf in the three directories with the
following content:
[global]
fsid = 306410d2-e503-11ee-86f8-xxxxxxxxxxx
mon_initial_members = ceph-0
mon_host = 192.168.1.134
auth_cluster_required = cephx
auth_service_required = cephx
auth_client_required = cephx
Copy the Cinder keyring files, ceph.client.cinder.keyring and ceph.client.cinderbackup.keyring (created in section 3.3.2), to cinder-volume and cinder-backup,
respectively.
Create the /etc/kolla/config/nova directory and copy ceph.client.cinder.keyring to it.



Step 3 Add Manila-related configurations.
Create the /etc/kolla/config/manila directory and create ceph.conf in it with the
following content:
[global]
fsid = 306410d2-e503-11ee-86f8-xxxxxxxxxxx
mon_initial_members = ceph-0
mon_host = 192.168.1.134
auth_cluster_required = cephx
auth_service_required = cephx
auth_client_required = cephx
Create the /etc/kolla/config/manila/manila-share directory and copy
ceph.clinetmanila.keyring created in section 3.3.2 to it.
