Step 1 Install the OpenStack client.
pip install python-openstackclient -c https://releases.openstack.org/constraints/upper/master
Import environment variables.
source /etc/kolla/admin-openrc.sh
Verify client installation and environment variable activation.
openstack --version
openstack availability zone list

Step 2 Check compute resources.
The cluster should contain a compute node as planned. If the deployment is successful,
the following information will be displayed:
openstack hypervisor list
If the compute node is missing, verify that all automated deployment operations are
successful. If any operation fails, redeploy the node and ensure all components are
deployed.

Step 3 Check storage resources.
The backend storage of the cluster should contain a resource pool provided by RADOS
Block Device (RBD) as planned. Run the following command to check the resource pool
status:
openstack volume service list
If the resource pool status is normal, the following information will be displayed:
openstack volme service list


Otherwise, check whether the configuration in section 3.3.3 is correct and whether the
following content in global.yml corresponds to the configuration in section 3.3.3:
After the faults are rectified, perform the deployment again.



Step 4 Check the user interface.
Access the Skyline dashboard through http://192.168.1.131:9999 to check the status of
OpenStack services.
